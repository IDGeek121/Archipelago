def set_all_location_rules(world: APQuestWorld) -> None:
    # Location rules work no differently from Entrance rules.
    # Most of our locations are chests that can simply be opened by walking up to them.
    # Thus, their logical requirements are covered by the Entrance rules of the Entrances that were required to
    # reach the region that the chest sits in.
    # However, our two enemies work differently.
    # Entering the room with the enemy is not enough, you also need to have enough combat items to be able to defeat it.
    # So, we need to set requirements on the Locations themselves.
    # Since combat is a bit more complicated, we'll use this chance to cover some advanced access rule concepts.

    # In "set_all_entrance_rules", we had a rule for a location that doesn't always exist.
    # In this case, we had to check for its existence (by checking the player's chosen options) before setting the rule.
    # Other times, you may have a situation where a location can have two different rules depending on the options.
    # In our case, the enemy in the right room has more health if hard mode is selected,
    # so ontop of the Sword, the player will either need one more health or a Shield in hard mode.
    # First, let's make our sword condition.
    can_defeat_basic_enemy: Rule = Has("Sword")

    # Next, we'll check whether hard mode has been chosen in the player options.
    if world.options.hard_mode:
        # We'll make the condition for "Has a Shield or a Health Upgrade".
        # We can chain two "Has" conditions together with the | operator to make "Has Shield or has Health Upgrade".
        can_withstand_a_hit = Has("Shield") | Has("Health Upgrade")

        # Now, we chain this rule to our Sword rule.
        # Since we want both conditions to be true, in this case, we have to chain them in an "and" way.
        # For this, we can use the & operator.
        can_defeat_basic_enemy = can_defeat_basic_enemy & can_withstand_a_hit

    # Finally, we set our rule onto the Right Room Eney Drop location.
    right_room_enemy = world.get_location("Right Room Enemy Drop")
    world.set_rule(right_room_enemy, can_defeat_basic_enemy)

    # For the final boss, we also need to chain multiple conditions.
    # First of all, you always need a Sword and a Shield.
    # So far, we used the | and & operators to chain "Has" rules.
    # Instead, we can also use HasAny for an or-chain of items, or HasAll for an and-chain of items.
    has_sword_and_shield: Rule = HasAll("Sword", "Shield")

    # In hard mode, the player also needs both Health Upgrades to survive long enough to defeat the boss.
    # For this, we can use the optional "count" parameter for "Has".
    has_both_health_upgrades = Has("Health Upgrade", count=2)

    # Previously, we used an "if world.options.hard_mode" condition to check if we should apply the extra requirement.
    # However, if you're comfortable with boolean logic, there is another way.
    # OptionFilter is a rule component which isn't a "Rule" on its own, but when used in a boolean expression with
    # rules, it acts like True if the option has the specified value, and acts like False otherwise.
    hard_mode_is_off = OptionFilter(HardMode, False)

    # So with this option-checking rule component in hand, we can write our boss condition like this:
    can_defeat_final_boss = has_sword_and_shield & (hard_mode_is_off | has_both_health_upgrades)
    # If you're not as comfortable with boolean logic, it might be somewhat confusing why this is correct.
    # There is nothing wrong with using "if" conditions to check for options, if you find that easier to understand.

    # Finally, we apply the rule to our "Final Boss Defeated" event location.
    final_boss = world.get_location("Final Boss Defeated")
    world.set_rule(final_boss, can_defeat_final_boss)


def set_completion_condition(world: APQuestWorld) -> None:
    # Finally, we need to set a completion condition for our world, defining what the player needs to win the game.
    # For this, we can use world.set_completion_rule.
    # You can just set a completion condition directly like any other condition, referencing items the player receives:
    world.set_completion_rule(HasAll("Sword", "Shield"))

    # In our case, we went for the Victory event design pattern (see create_events() in locations.py).
    # So lets undo what we just did, and instead set the completion condition to:
    world.set_completion_rule(Has("Victory"))


# One final comment about rules:
# If your world exclusively uses Rule Builder rules (like APQuest), it's worth trying CachedRuleBuilderWorld.
# CachedRuleBuilderWorld is a subclass of World that has a bunch of caching magic to make rules faster.
# Just have your world class subclass CachedRuleBuilderWorld instead of World:
#   class APQuestWorld(CachedRuleBuilderWorld): ...
# This may speed up your world, or it may make it slower.
# The exact factors are complex and not well understood, but there is no harm in trying it.
# Generate a few seeds and see if there is a noticeable difference!
# If you're wondering, author has checked: APQuest is too simple to see any benefits, so we'll stick with "World".
